    ABSTRACT="Function words like articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and especially pronouns are important to Text Analysis as they reveal much more about someone’s psychological state than content words do. In this study, we present the development of a pronoun enriched dictionary for text analysis in Portuguese, named PronounBP, which is based on the Brazilian Portuguese (BP) language version of the LIWC dictionary. Pronouns have a great importance in Text Analysis, so we included in PronounBP as many Portuguese pronouns as possible. In this work, we carry out two experiments. The first one presents a statistical comparison of percentage values in categories obtained for bilingual texts, using LIWC, PronounBP and the already available BP LIWC dictionary. It provides satisfactory results since higher correlation results using PronounBP are obtained. We also produced an empirical evaluation in a computational linguistic analysis task, and PronounBP has also achieved better results than already available BP LIWC dictionary.",
